# Public a Service and Route Traffic by Subdomain and Path

![Overview](/fcj-ss2-workshop-002/images/01.webp)

## 1. Overview

Hello everyone! In this workshop, I will accompany you to explore an important concept in Kubernetes, which is ingress, and proceed to public a service and route traffic using subdomains and paths.

In Kubernetes, there are many types and versions available, but in a learning or lab environment, we can use more compact and lightweight versions of Kubernetes like Minikube, K3s, MicroK8s, etc. In this series, I will be using MicroK8s.

## 2. Objectives

The objective of this workshop series is to provide you with the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes.

This will also serve as a foundation for many future workshop series on Kubernetes.

## 3. Content

- Introduction to Ingress.
